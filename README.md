## To Install
This is an electron application.
To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/sadeepdarshana/youtube-mini-window-desktop

cd youtube-mini-window-desktop

Install electron-packager cli and ```electron-packager ./ MiniYouTube --platform=win32 --arch=x64 --overwrite``` to create an executable if you want.

## To Use
Press ```F6``` to toggle between mini mode and normal size mode. It only makes sense to go to the mini mode once you are playing a video.

Press ```F7``` to toggle between full screen and normal size mode.
